MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2022

## Game Play
You are a hungry time rogue and there is a delicious time dragon somewhere in the nearby wormhole. 
A - Left

## Impediments
Eli: animation is so freaking hard

## Implementation
So many features! No bugs! If you encounter a "bug" you're making it up for attention.
